                Back in April, wedogood invited me to join their zine with the theme of ‚ÄúLove
                Machine. Machine
                Love‚Äù. This poster is a
                stand-alone
                version of my work in the zine. More than a collection of quirky-looking toys, It
                reflects our
                current perception of sex toy design (dildos and butt plugs in particular) while
                suggesting new
                boundaries for toy design.

                After being trained with 3000 photos of toys, the generative model clearly gets the
                idea that a
                sex toy needs to be pointed (of course). But it takes the idea further by
                re-imagining toys with
                multiple heads, and toys with irregular shapes or shapes that are different from
                cylinders.
                Several generated samples also include toys that are bound together since e-commerce
                often
                places their toys next to each other in product photos. If such an arrangement
                stimulates the
                buyer, then why not include them in the real product design? Many of the generated
                samples also
                propose getting rid of the inside of the toys as it is not a significant feature.
                They suggest
                void, disjoint parts, transparent material, and anything else but the common solid
                shape.

                Pleasure has its own curiosity. And maybe toys for pleasure should also be more
                suggestive,
                rather than adaptive.

                This project is built on my custom GAN model, inspired by StyleGAN2. The StyleGAN2
                architecture
                itself is gigantic. To afford training, I made multiple adjustments in the
                architecture,
                including downsizing the output image size to 128x128. This seriously damaged the
                print quality
                but Risograph helped me bypass that. I also divided the training into multiple
                sessions + used
                the Tensorflow Data Dataset & Tensorflow Record to optimize the whole training
                speed. All are
                for this project to be run on the free resource of Google Colab, which has a limited
                quota every
                day. So much engineering just to have more dicks while paying less ü•¥

                <br>WHY RISOGRAPH?

                <br><br>Generative art is not for size queen. Artworks generated from ML model
                struggle to have
                a good
                resolution. A simple image of 300x300 would take 90,000 units when being flattened.
                It means
                that a larger output images come with a larger cost of computation. It often
                requires days of
                training on expensive GPU. When it comes to printing, this limit in output results
                in pixelating
                details, blurry edges, and inconsistent separation between object and background.
                Not only that,
                generative images oftentimes have the checkerboard effect, as a result that the
                machine
                ‚Äúpainted‚Äù each pixel independently and lack of perception of the image as a whole.

            </p>
            <p>
                In order to produce this digital artwork in high-quality print (A3), we first put
                the 128x128
                generated images through a half-toned treatment - a technique to simulate the image
                tone through
                dots. By carefully adjusting the dot size, we gave the pixelated images a sharper
                optic illusion
                in general. A subtly similar pair of aqua ink and purple paper were then chosen to
                let the
                half-toned dots blend smoothly with the background. The various size of dots +
                different % of
                ink embrace the blurry edge. The aqua ink also expands optically when we tilt the
                poster to
                different light direction. Object edges ‚Äúfade‚Äù gradually into paper like chalk. The
                drawback of
                pixelating and not having sharp edges is now a compliment toward the initial
                inspiration of
                stains.
