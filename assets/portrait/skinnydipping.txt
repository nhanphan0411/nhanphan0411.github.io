some boys
have ghosted
from this high
but I wanna go
down on you
anyway to leap
from the bridge
I’ve made
of my wrongs look
they lied to us
no one here
was ever ugly look
if you see
me then
I prayed
correctly I leapt
from the verb
taking off
my best shirt
this rag & rage
a tulip too late
in summer’s teeth
like the blade
in a guillotine I won’t
pick a side
my name a past
tense where I left
my hands
for good oh
it should be
enough to live
& die alone
with music on
your tongue
to jump from
anywhere & make it
home
to be warm & full of
nothing oh
I kept my hope
-blue Vans on
this whole time
to distract you
from my flat ass
did it work oh
my people my people
I thought
the fall would
kill me
but it only
made me real
